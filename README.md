## 💡 About

CivicPulse utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector search to transform how civic issues are tracked and resolved. Unlike traditional ticketing systems, CivicPulse understands the _context_ of complaints, automatically grouping similar issues (clustering) and allowing administrators to "chat" with their data to uncover trends.
